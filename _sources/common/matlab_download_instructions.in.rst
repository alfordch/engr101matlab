2. Move the file to your current folder in MATLAB. As a reminder, when you open MATLAB, you can see which folder it is currently working in (highlighted in red, click for larger image):

   | |matlab1|
   |

You can change this folder by clicking on the "open folder" icon to the left of the file path. I've circled it here in red (click to see a larger image):

| |matlab2|

In this chapter, we'll take a look at how to use MATLAB to manipulate images. Matlab is very efficient at storing information as numbers in a matrix, like in matrix :code:`a` below.

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <table><tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <div class="matcrab-vis-exp">
            a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
            a;
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <br />
  </div>

These numbers can represent calculations, data, and even colors! Before we jump into talking about images, let's warm up by practicing a few operations we learned in previous chapters to change matrices (these will be used on images later in this chapter!).

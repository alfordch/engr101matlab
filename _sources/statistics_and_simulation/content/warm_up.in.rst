The Great Lakes produce a phenomenon called lake effect snow. As described by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 

  Lake effect snow occurs when cold air, often originating from Canada, moves across the open waters of the Great Lakes. As the cold air passes over the unfrozen and relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes, warmth and moisture are transferred into the lowest portion of the atmosphere. The air rises, clouds form and grow into narrow bands that produce 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour or more.

Here is a satellite picture of lake effect snow:

As winter progresses and the air temperatures stay low, the surface waters of the Great Lakes start to freeze over:

The more ice there is on a lake's surface, the less lake effect snow will be produced. Here is an example of Lake Superior with almost total ice coverage:

Therefore, tracking ice coverage is critical to forecasting the weather in winter for those areas around the Great Lakes. Years with high ice coverage can have lower total snowfall amounts, and years with low ice coverage can have higher total snowfall amounts. The percentage of ice cover also affects the evaporation rates of the Great Lakes, which in turn affects water levels in the Great Lakes (as does the snowfall amounts).

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) has been tracking the percentage of ice coverage of each of the Great Lakes (Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario) since the 1970s. Let's find the highest maximum ice coverage for each lake and the lowest maximum ice coverage for each lake.

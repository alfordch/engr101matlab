This exercise uses the following files.

- :file:`cities.xslx`
- :file:`CityLatitudes.m`

Please ensure you have downloaded these exercise files (see the chapter files box at the beginning of this chapter) and placed them in your current MATLAB folder.

Open the :file:`CityLatitudes.m` in MATLAB. We've provided an outline for your code, as well as initial code to read data from the Excel file, :file:`cities.xlsx`, and extract the data into three parallel vectors :code:`pop`, :code:`lat`, and :code:`lon` representing the cities' populations, latitudes, and longitudes, respectively. (Don't worry about how specifically the :code:`xlsread` function works - we'll come back to this in a later chapter.)

Fill in the missing code to generate some basic statistical measures of the latitudes of the world's largest cities. Answer the questions below based on your analysis.
